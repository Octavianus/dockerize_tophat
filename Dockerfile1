### Try to dockermize the Tophat.
## 1.import the samtools from the images registry.

# I tried to compile the boost_1_55_0 for the tophat, but it seems that there some trivial# errors when compiling it, also the time for compiling is too long for a laptop.
# Therefore, I use the already exited the dockermized Tophat which with samtools installe # to be my base image.
